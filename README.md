This game is a strategical RTS based on pygame graphical engine.

How a game goes :
  - You first receive a country randomly, and some resources.
  - Step by step you can upgrade your productions infrastructures to get more income.
  - Then you can buy troops to attack other players.
  - The goal is to get the entire world.
  - 1 player with 31 IA (Multiplayer will maybe be developped in the future)
  
How an attack goes :
  - You first choose the country to attack.
  - Then you enter the attack.
  - Begin the attack by choosing your troops (troops that you have previously trained)
  - Then you begin a fight against country's defenses in an RTS engine.
  - You command your units by clicking on them and righ clicking to make them move/attack.
  - You can also order aerial strikes from the planes you affected to the battle.
  - The battle ends up when all units of a side are destroyed.
  - Enemies are controlled by an IA.
